# C class Projects 

The first project is a Morse code made to run in a Arduino Uno, prepared and reviewed to be efficient and effective to run smoothly in the Arduino.

the materials used was the Arduino Uno, Wires, connector, LED's and a a buzzer, to display the sounds of morse code

Here bellow the the logical diagram of the project:

The second project was made for a different reason,a activity proposed in the classroom by the teacher, so that we can individually use the knowledge acquired in the subject of C.

A C code made to display a betting game in a way that is as close to reality as possible 

# Why?
Itâ€™s a quick way to edit and navigate code. It's especially useful if you want to edit multiple files at a time or take advantage of all the powerful code editing features of Visual Studio Code when making a quick change.
